## QC of AD-Data

Three QC's are added. There are in total 148*148 connections in each connectome. Each QC computes finds number of outlier connections among these connections.
If this outlier connection number exceeds a certain limit, the connectome is marked as outlier. The definition of outlier connection is different for each QC.
